# Specification for the functional core of cmake/UriChez.cmake.
#
# Discovery has to decide, from a probe's output alone, whether a binary is the
# Chez uri needs. Three things can go wrong and only one of them is
# obvious:
#
#   - the binary is not Chez at all (a `scheme` on PATH may be anything);
#   - it is Petite, which has no compile-program and so cannot run the AOT lane;
#   - it is too old for the include and bytevector surface the project uses.
#
# WHY THREADING IS NOT CHECKED
#
# uri has no threads anywhere in its design, so requiring a threaded build
# would reject a perfectly good runtime for no reason. The probe still reports
# the flag and discovery still records it, because portability evidence names
# the exact runtime that produced it -- but it is evidence, not a gate.
